# Fork
This project is a fork of [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit).

One major enhancement is that it lets you set your own `Client ID` as a setting.
This means you don't need to recompile it each time, or to use [ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager).

# Setup
See [SETUP.md](/SETUP.md)

To log in with the webview-less method, paste the oauth URL you get from continuum into a *MOBILE* browser (only been tested on firefox on android so far), log in, allow access, and when reddit tries to redirect you, tap on the page *once*. This should leave you on the "redirecting to (url)" page. If unsuccessful, simply repeat until successful. Copy the redirect URL, and paste it in continuum.

# Installation
You can easily install and update Continuum with [Discoverium](https://github.com/cygnusx-1-org/Discoverium/) via its search button.
